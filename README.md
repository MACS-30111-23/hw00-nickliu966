Edit this README file to include a brief biography of yourself. Your README should include the following elements:
* Headers (one or more)
* Emphasis (italics or/and bold)
* Lists
* Images: add a picture (of yourself or something else) to your repo and embed it in your README
* Links
* A summary and reflection of the Git/GitHub workflow you adopted for this homework, and of your experience with Markdown (e.g., provide a summary of the workflow you adopted, and add some comments about something new you learned, something that surprised you, etc.)

# This is the first MACS30111 assignment
## Introduction
My name is **Zhenning Liu**, a student in the 2023 MACSS cohort. I majored in psychology during my undergrad and is eager to learn computing techniques to enable my research interest in cognitive psychology domain. 

## What I like
During my spare time, I enjoy 
- gaming
- sports
- lying on my bed or couch watching youtube or netflix

## Summary and reflection
- In this homework, my workflow starts with an introduction and then I add features as I see fit along the way. For example, I write My name is Zhenning Liu, where I thought it might be appropriate to bold the name to emphasize my identity (who is the owner of this page). If I encounter something I am not familiar with, I go to github docs where I find basic formatting syntax tips. Then I commit the change and push it. 

- In this homework I learn a lot of useful tips to format the markdown, for example how to include a link or image. I also learn that it is important to organize the markdown page so that it seems natural, logical, and flows well -- just to make it clean and readable.

- something that suprises me is that the markdown can do so many things -- all without any buttons to click.
